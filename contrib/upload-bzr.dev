# example of how to upload a bzr tree using rsync

# --include-from is used to make sure that only versioned files and
# control files are copied.  We use includes/excludes rather than
# --files-from so that we can delete any files from the destination
# that are no longer present on the source.

cd ~/work/bzr 

# note: don't use -a because that can mess up the permissions
