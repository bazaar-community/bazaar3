"""http/https transport using pycurl"""

from __future__ import absolute_import

# TODO: test reporting of http errors
#
# TODO: Transport option to control caching of particular requests; broadly we
# would want to offer "caching allowed" or "must revalidate", depending on
# whether we expect a particular file will be modified after it's committed.
# It's probably safer to just always revalidate.  mbp 20060321

# TODO: Some refactoring could be done to avoid the strange idiom
# used to capture data and headers while setting up the request
# (and having to pass 'header' to _curl_perform to handle
# redirections) . This could be achieved by creating a
# specialized Curl object and returning code, headers and data
# from _curl_perform.  Not done because we may deprecate pycurl in the
# future -- vila 20070212
