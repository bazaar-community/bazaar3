"""All of bzr.

Developer documentation is available at
http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/bzr.dev/developers/

The project website is at http://bazaar.canonical.com/

Some particularly interesting things in bzrlib are:

 * bzrlib.initialize -- setup the library for use
 * bzrlib.plugin.load_plugins -- load all installed plugins
 * bzrlib.branch.Branch.open -- open a branch
 * bzrlib.workingtree.WorkingTree.open -- open a working tree

We hope you enjoy this library.
