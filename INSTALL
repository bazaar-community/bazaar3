bzr install instructions
************************

Dependencies
------------

bzr requires Python 2.6 or newer.

If you wish to access branches over sftp, you will need paramiko and
pycrypto:

bzr can optionally use compiled versions of some parts of the code
for increased speed. When installing bzr you need the ability to
build C extensions. Some GNU/Linux distributions package the necessary
headers separately from the main Python package. This package is
probably named something like python-dev or python-devel. FreeBSD,
Windows, source-based GNU/Linux distributions, and possibly other operating
systems, have the required files installed by default.

If you are installing bzr from a bzr branch rather than a release tarball,
then you should also have the Pyrex package installed. This is not necessary
for release tarballs as they already contain the C files that Pyrex is needed
to create.

Installation
------------

When upgrading using setup.py, it is recommended that you first delete the
bzrlib directory from the install target.

To install bzr as a user, run

  python setup.py install --home ~ 

To install system-wide, run (as root)

  python setup.py install
