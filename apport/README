Bazaar supports semi-automatic bug reporting through Apport
<https://launchpad.net/apport/>.

If apport is not installed, an exception is printed to stderr in the usual way.

For this to work properly it's suggested that two files be installed when a
package of bzr is installed:

``bzr.conf``
    into ``/etc/apport/crashdb.conf.d``

``source_bzr.py`` 
    into ``/usr/share/apport/package-hooks``
