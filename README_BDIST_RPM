There is a bug in disttools for distributions who's rpmbuild compresses 
the man pages. This causes an error building the final packages as it's 
expecting bzr.1 and not finding it, but finding bzr.1.gz that's unpackaged.

This bug is known to affect Fedora, RHEL, and Centos distributions.

There is a preliminary patch at http://bugs.python.org/issue644744 that
fixes this issue with disttools.
