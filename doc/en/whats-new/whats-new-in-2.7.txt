What's New in Bazaar 2.7?
*************************

Bazaar 2.7 has been released on the 1st of February 2016 and marks the start
of a new long-term stable series. From here, we will only make bugfix
releases on the 2.7 series (2.7.1, etc), while 2.8 will become our new
development series.


This document accumulates a high level summary of what's changed.  See the
:doc:`../release-notes/index` for a full list.

Users are encouraged to upgrade from the other stable series.  This document
outlines the improvements in Bazaar 2.7 vs Bazaar 2.6. As well as
summarizing improvements made to the core product, it highlights
enhancements within the broader Bazaar world of potential interest to those
upgrading.

Bazaar 2.7.0 is fully compatible both locally and on the network with 2.0,
2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6, and can read and write repositories
generated by all previous versions.

python-2.6 EOL'ed
*****************

python 2.6 has been EOL'ed since the release of bzr 2.6. The last python 2.6
version was released on 2013-10-29. While bzr 2.7 remains compatible with
python 2.6, no further update of bzr is expected in this regard.

SSL Certificate Verification Support in urllib HTTPS backend
************************************************************

python 2.7 received security updates regarding SSL certificate
verification. bzr 2.7 relies on the ssl python module for this and as such
benefit from these security updates.

This isn't true for python 2.6 so users are encouraged to upgrade.

Users that cannot upgrade will be warned that the hostname cannot be
verified and can remove the warnings by setting the ``ssl.cert_reqs`` option
to ``none``.

Test reliability
****************

Most of the bug fixes in 2.7 are related to test failures triggered by
various python 2.7 updates. Among other distributions, debian and ubuntu
have carried patches that have now part of bzr 2.7.
