What's New in Bazaar 2.6?
*************************

Bazaar 2.6 has been released on the 27th of July 2013 and marks the start of
a new long-term stable series. From here, we will only make bugfix releases
on the 2.6 series (2.6.1, etc), while 2.7 will become our new development
series.


This document accumulates a high level summary of what's changed.  See the
:doc:`../release-notes/index` for a full list.

Users are encouraged to upgrade from the other stable series.  This document
outlines the improvements in Bazaar 2.6 vs Bazaar 2.5. As well as
summarizing improvements made to the core product, it highlights
enhancements within the broader Bazaar world of potential interest to those
upgrading.

Bazaar 2.6.0 is fully compatible both locally and on the network with 2.0,
2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5, and can read and write repositories generated by
all previous versions.
