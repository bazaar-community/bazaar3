bzr 1.16.1
##########

:Released: 2009-06-26

End user testing of the 2a format revealed two serious bugs. The first,
#365615, caused bzr to raise AbsentContentFactory errors when autopacking.
This meant that commits or pushes to 2a-format repositories failed
intermittently.

The second bug, #390563, caused the smart server to raise AbsentContentFactory
when streaming 2a stacked 2a-format branches. This particularly affected
branches stored on Launchpad in the 2a format.

Both of these bugs cause command failures only, neither of them cause data
corruption or data loss. And, of course, both of these bugs are now fixed.

Bug Fixes
*********

* We now properly request a more minimal set of file texts when fetching
  multiple revisions. (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel, #390563)

* Repositories using CHK pages (which includes the new 2a format) will no
  longer error during commit or push operations when an autopack operation
  is triggered. (Robert Collins, #365615)

* ``chk_map.iter_interesting_nodes`` now properly uses the *intersection*
  of referenced nodes rather than the *union* to determine what
  uninteresting pages we still need to look at. Prior to this,
  incrementally pushing to stacked branch would push the minimal data, but
  fetching everything would request extra texts. There are some unhandled
  cases wrt trees of different depths, but this fixes the common cases.
  (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel, #390563)

* ``GroupCompress`` repositories now take advantage of the pack hints
  parameter to permit cross-format fetching to incrementally pack the
  converted data. (Robert Collins)

* ``Repository.commit_write_group`` now returns opaque data about what
  was committed, for passing to the ``Repository.pack``. Repositories
  without atomic commits will still return None. (Robert Collins)

* ``Repository.pack`` now takes an optional ``hint`` parameter
  which will support doing partial packs for repositories that can do
  that. (Robert Collins)

* RepositoryFormat has a new attribute 'pack_compresses' which is True
  when doing a pack operation changes the compression of content in the
  repository. (Robert Collins)

* ``StreamSink`` and ``InterDifferingSerialiser`` will call
  ``Repository.pack`` with the hint returned by
  ``Repository.commit_write_group`` if the formats were different and the
  repository can increase compression by doing a pack operation.

bzr 1.16
########
:Codename: yesterday-in-california
:1.16rc1: 2009-06-11
:1.16: 2009-06-18

This version of Bazaar contains the beta release of the new ``2a`` repository
format, suitable for testing by fearless, advanced users. This format or an
updated version of it will become the default format in Bazaar 2.0. Please
read the NEWS entry before even thinking about upgrading to the new format.

Also included are speedups for many operations on huge projects, a bug fix for
pushing stacked new stacked branches to smart servers and the usual bevy of
bug fixes and improvements.


Changes from 1.16rc1 to 1.16final
*********************************

* Fix the nested tree flag check so that upgrade from development formats to
  2a can work correctly.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #388727)

* Automatic format upgrades triggered by default stacking policies on a
  1.16rc1 (or later) smart server work again.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #388675)


Compatibility Breaks
********************

* Display prompt on stderr (instead of stdout) when querying users so
  that the output of commands can be safely redirected.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #376582)


New Features
************

* A new repository format ``2a`` has been added.  This is a beta release
  of the brisbane-core (aka group-compress) project.  This format now
  suitable for wider testing by advanced users willing to deal with some
  bugs.  We would appreciate test reports, either positive or negative.
  Format 2a is substantially smaller and faster for many operations on
  many trees.  This format or an updated version will become the default
  in bzr 2.0.

  This is a rich-root format, so this repository format can be used with
  bzr-svn.  Bazaar branches in previous non-rich-root formats can be
  converted (including by merge, push and pull) to format 2a, but not vice
  versa.  We recommend upgrading previous development formats to 2a.

  Upgrading to this format can take considerable time because it expands
  and more concisely repacks the full history.

  If you use stacked branches, you must upgrade the stacked branches
  before the stacked-on branches.  (See <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/374735>)

* ``--development7-rich-root`` is a new dev format, similar to ``--dev6``
  but using a Revision serializer using bencode rather than XML.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, John Arbash Meinel)

* mail_client=claws now supports --body (and message body hooks).  Also uses
  configured from address.  (Barry Warsaw)

Improvements
************


* ``--development6-rich-root`` can now stack. (Modulo some smart-server
  bugs with stacking and non default formats.)
  (John Arbash Meinel, #373455)

* ``--development6-rich-root`` delays generating a delta index for the
  first object inserted into a group. This has a beneficial impact on
  ``bzr commit`` since each committed texts goes to its own group. For
  committing a 90MB file, it drops peak memory by about 200MB, and speeds
  up commit from 7s => 4s. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Numerous operations are now faster for huge projects, i.e. those
  with a large number of files and/or a large number of revisions,
  particularly when the latest development format is used. These
  operations (and improvements on OpenOffice.org) include:

  * branch in a shared repository (2X faster)
  * branch --no-tree (100X faster)
  * diff (2X faster)
  * tags (70X faster)

  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Pyrex version of ``bencode`` support. This provides optimized support
  for both encoding and decoding, and is now found at ``bzrlib.bencode``.
  ``bzrlib.utils.bencode`` is now deprecated.
  (Alexander Belchenko, Jelmer Vernooij, John Arbash Meinel)


Bug Fixes
*********

* Bazaar can now pass attachment files to the mutt email client.
  (Edwin Grubbs, #384158)

* Better message in ``bzr add`` output suggesting using ``bzr ignored`` to
  see which files can also be added.  (Jason Spashett, #76616)

* ``bzr pull -r 123`` from a stacked branch on a smart server no longer fails.
  Also, the ``Branch.revision_history()`` API now works in the same
  situation.  (Andrew Bennetts, #380314)
  
* ``bzr serve`` on Windows no longer displays a traceback simply because a
  TCP client disconnected. (Andrew Bennetts)

* Clarify the rules for locking and fallback repositories. Fix bugs in how
  ``RemoteRepository`` was handling fallbacks along with the
  ``_real_repository``. (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel, #375496)

* Fix a small bug with fetching revisions w/ ghosts into a new stacked
  branch. Not often triggered, because it required ghosts to be part of
  the fetched revisions, not in the stacked-on ancestry.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Fix status and commit to work with content filtered trees, addressing
  numerous bad bugs with line-ending support. (Ian Clatworthy, #362030)

* Fix problem of "directory not empty" when contending for a lock over
  SFTP.  (Martin Pool, #340352)

* Fix rule handling so that eol is optional, not mandatory.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #379370)

* Pushing a new stacked branch to a 1.15 smart server was broken due to a
  bug in the ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex`` smart verb.  This is fixed in
  1.16, but required changes to the network protocol, so the
  ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex`` verb has been removed and replaced with a
  corrected ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex_1.16`` verb.  1.15 clients will
  still work with a 1.16 server as they will fallback to slower (and
  bug-free) methods.
  (Jonathan Lange, Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts, #385132)

* Reconcile can now deal with text revisions that originated in revisions 
  that are ghosts. (Jelmer Vernooij, #336749)

* Support cloning of branches with ghosts in the left hand side history.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #248540)

* The ''bzr diff'' now catches OSError from osutils.rmtree and logs a
  helpful message to the trace file, unless the temp directory really was
  removed (which would be very strange).  Since the diff operation has
  succeeded from the user's perspective, no output is written to stderr 
  or stdout.  (Maritza Mendez, #363837)

* Translate errors received from a smart server in response to a
  ``BzrDirFormat.initialize`` or ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex`` request.
  This was causing tracebacks even for mundane errors like
  ``PermissionDenied``.  (Andrew Bennetts, #381329)

Documentation
*************

* Added directory structure and started translation of docs in Russian.
  (Alexey Shtokalo, Alexander Iljin, Alexander Belchenko, Dmitry Vasiliev,
  Volodymyr Kotulskyi)

API Changes
***********

* Added osutils.parent_directories(). (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``bzrlib.progress.ProgressBar``, ``ChildProgress``, ``DotsProgressBar``,
  ``TTYProgressBar`` and ``child_progress`` are now deprecated; use
  ``ui_factory.nested_progress_bar`` instead.  (Martin Pool)

* ``graph.StackedParentsProvider`` is now a public API, replacing
  ``graph._StackedParentsProvider``. The api is now considered stable and ready
  for external users. (Gary van der Merwe)

* ``bzrlib.user_encoding`` is deprecated in favor of
  ``get_user_encoding``.  (Alexander Belchenko)

* TreeTransformBase no longer assumes that limbo is provided via disk.
  DiskTreeTransform now provides disk functionality.  (Aaron Bentley)

Internals
*********

* Remove ``weave.py`` script for accessing internals of old weave-format
  repositories.  (Martin Pool)

Testing
*******

* ``make check`` no longer repeats the test run in ``LANG=C``.
  (Martin Pool, #386180)

* The number of cores is now correctly detected on OSX. (John Szakmeister)

* The number of cores is also detected on Solaris and win32. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* The number of cores is also detected on FreeBSD. (Matthew Fuller)
