Getting help
============

Bazaar comes with a built-in on-line help system, accessed through::

  bzr help

You can ask for help on a command, or on non-command topics.  To see a
list of available help of each kind, use either::

  bzr help commands
  bzr help topics

For help on a particular command, use either of these forms::

  bzr help status
  bzr status --help

If you wish to search the help or read it as a larger document, the
information is also available in the Bazaar User Reference.
