Entering commands
=================

User interfaces
---------------

There are numerous user interfaces available for Bazaar.
The core package provides a command line tool called **bzr** and
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are available as plug-ins.

Using bzr
---------

The syntax is::

  bzr [global-options] command [options and arguments]

Global options affect how Bazaar operates and can appear either
before or after ``command``. Command specific options must appear
after the command but may be given either before, during or after any
command-specific arguments.

Common options
--------------

Some options are legal for all commands as shown below.

  ==========  =========  =================
  Short form  Long form  Description
  ==========  =========  =================
  -h          --help     get help
  -v          --verbose  be more verbose
  -q          --quiet    be more quiet
  ==========  =========  =================

Quiet mode implies that only errors and warnings are displayed.
This can be useful in scripts.

Note: Most commands typically only support one level of verbosity though
that may change in the future. To ask for a higher level of verbosity,
simply specify the -v option multiple times.
