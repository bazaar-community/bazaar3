The journey ahead
=================

We hope that earlier chapters have given you a solid
understanding of how Bazaar can assist you in being productive
on your own and working effectively with others.
If you are learning Bazaar for the first time, it might be
good to try the procedures covered already for a while,
coming back to this manual once you have mastered them.

Remaining chapters
covers various topics to guide you in further optimizing how you
use Bazaar. Unless stated otherwise, the topics in this and
remaining chapters are independent of each other and can therefore
be read in whichever order you wish.
