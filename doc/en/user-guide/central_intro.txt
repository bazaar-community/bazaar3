Centralized development
=======================

Motivation
----------

Rather than working in parallel and occasionally merging, it can be
useful at times to work in lockstep, i.e. for multiple people to
be continuously committing changes to a central location, merging
their work with the latest content before every commit.

This workflow is very familiar to users of central VCS tools like
Subversion and CVS. It is also applicable to a single developer
who works on multiple machines, e.g. someone who normally works
on a desktop computer but travels with a laptop, or someone who
uses their (Internet connected) home computer to complete office
work out of hours.

If centralized development works well for your team already, that's
great. Many teams begin using Bazaar this way and experiment with
alternative workflows later.

The diagram below provides an overview of the *centralized workflow*.

Even if your team is planning to use a more distributed workflow, many
of the tasks covered in this chapter may be useful to you, particularly
how to publish branches.
