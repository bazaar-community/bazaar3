BzrTools
========

Overview
--------

BzrTools is a collection of useful enhancements to Bazaar.
For installation instructions, see the BzrTools home page:
http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/BzrTools.
Here is a sample of the frequently used commands it provides.


shell
-----

``bzr shell`` starts up a command interpreter than understands
Bazaar commands natively. This has several advantages:

 * There's no need to type ``bzr`` at the front of every command.

 * Intelligent auto-completion is provided.

 * Commands run slightly faster as there's no need to load Bazaar's
   libraries each time.


cdiff
-----

``bzr cdiff`` provides a colored version of ``bzr diff`` output.
On GNU/Linux, UNIX and OS X, this is often used like this::

  bzr cdiff | less -R
