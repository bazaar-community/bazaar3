Going solo
==========

A personal productivity tool
----------------------------

Some tools are designed to make individuals productive (e.g. editors)
while other tools (e.g. back-end services) are focused on making teams
or whole companies more productive. Version control tools have
traditionally been in the latter camp.

One of the cool things about Bazaar is that it is so easy to setup
that version control can now be treated as a personal productivity tool.
If you wish to record changes to files for the purposes of checkpointing
good known states or tracking history, it is now easy to do so. This
chapter explains how.

The solo workflow
-----------------

If you are creating your own masterpiece, whether that be a software
project or a set of related documents, the typical workflow looks like this:

Even if you will always be working as part of a team, the tasks covered
in this chapter will be the basis of what you'll be doing so it's a good
place to start.
