Finding obsolete branches
-------------------------

If you use feature branching for developing each fix
and enhancement separately, you may have several old
branches that are no longer required. In many cases,
the relevant changes may now be merged into trunk.
In other cases, a branch may be obsolete thanks to
another change made by yourself or others.

When checking for an obsolete branch, there are three
things in particular to confirm:

1. The working tree has no in-progress changes.

2. The working tree has no shelved changes.

3. Any locally committed revisions have been merged
   into the parent branch.

After changing into the root of a branch, the commands
to check these things respectively are::

  bzr status
  bzr shelve --list
  bzr missing --mine-only

If your branches are stored in a shared repository locally,
you may find the *Local Changes* tab in Bazaar Explorer's
repository view helpful here (revision 159 or later) as it
shows a summary of these things, excluding the shelve information
currently, for each branch as you select it.
